# Limerick

Limerick (or _snake scape_) is a solved programming exercise for my OOP Students
at the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, based on [Lime Rick](http://www.kongregate.com/games/kissmaj7/lime-rick) game from Tommi 'Kismaj7'
Tuovinen.

The code is in Spanish language (sorry for the English-only speakers!)

## How to play

* Use cursor arrows to eat the apple.
* If you get stuck, press `R` to reset the stage.
